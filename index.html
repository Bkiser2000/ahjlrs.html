<h>Authority Having Jurisdictions: A Brief Overview</h>
</div>
<hr></hr>
<p style="font-size:125%;">This webpage will describe and outline Authority Having Jurisdictions (AHJ). The National Electrical Code (NEC) defines AHJ as “An organization, office or individual responsible for enforcing the requirements of a code or standard, or for approving equipment, materials, an installation or a procedure.” The following paragraph will outline how the Colorado Department Of Regulatory Agencies (DORA DORA THE EXPLORER!) facilitates permits/inspections and how to obtain them.</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;">A Colorado State Electrical permit that is valid is required to be possesed prior to any installation of electrical wiring.Permits remain valid for a duration of one year from the issuance of the permit. Electrical contractors and homeowners may obtain a permit online at <a href="https://dpo.colorado.gov/EandP/Permits/">this link.</a>The information we are about to present would be better in table format in a similar fahion as is presented in <a href="https://prbd.com/pubs/permitforms/2016permitfees.pdf">this pdf</a> from the Pueblo Regional Building Department.</P2>

<p style="font-size:125%">According to <a href="https://dpo.colorado.gov/Electrical/PermitInspectionInfo">colorao.gov</a> ,The process that is most effecient for requesting an electrical inspection is via their online permit system. Inspectors are tasked with the responsibility of keeping their daily inspection schedule in order. Requests for inspections should take place no later than 3PM the day before your inspection. Cell phones are not highly recommened due to the unreliable nature of cellular cignals. The inspection process is as follows: </p> 
</br>
<ol style="font-size:150%">
  <li>Once you have requested an inspection, the inspector will normally schedule your inspection within three days.</li>
  <li>After an inspection has been scheduled, you can access relevant information from your online account. Once at the bottom of the permit page, you should notice in 'red' a notice that alerts you of an inspection being scheduled for that day.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the site of inspection is available and that there is accesibility to the installation to the inspector from 8AM until 5PM.</li>
  <li>If this information is not provided on the permit, please contact your inspector with any updated driving directions, access codes, or phone numbers. It is advised not to fax your inspector this information the day of your inspection, as they will not receive it.</li>
  <li>To ensure a re-inspection fee isn't imposed, please make sure that the address number is posted and visible at the driveway entrance of the job site and that the site is ready for inspection.</li>
  <li>Inspections will not take place on state-mandated furlough days or official holidays.</li>
  <li>For more information, please visit the colorado.gov link mentioned above.</li>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p style="font-size:125%;">In conclusion, it is always good practice to contact your local jurisdiction for obtaining necessary electrical permits and inspections. The state of Colorado does not facilitate permits and inspections unless certain circumstances are met. Always ensure work is complete and up to applicable code standards before your scheduled inspection. Being prompt and professional is all you will honestly need to navigate the realm of permits and inspections. The following page is links to my sources as well as a link to a written bibliography.
