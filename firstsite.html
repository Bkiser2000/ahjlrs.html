</div>
<hr>
<p style="font-size:125%;">This webpage will describe and outline Authority Having Jurisdictions (AHJ). The National Electrical Code (NEC) defines AHJ as “An organization, office or individual responsible for enforcing the requirements of a code or standard, or for approving equipment, materials, an installation or a procedure.” The following paragraph will outline how the Colorado Department Of Regulatory Agencies (DORA DORA THE EXPLORER!) facilitates permits/inspections and how to obtain them.</p>
<p style="font-size:125%;text-indent:50px;">A Colorado State Electrical permit that is valid is required to be possesed prior to any installation of electrical wiring.Permits remain valid for a duration of one year from the issuance of the permit. Electrical contractors and homeowners may obtain a permit online at <a href="https://dpo.colorado.gov/EandP/Permits/">this link.</a>The information we are about to present would be better in table format in a similar fahion as is presented in <a href="https://prbd.com/pubs/permitforms/2016permitfees.pdf">this pdf</a> from the Pueblo Regional Building Department.</P2>
